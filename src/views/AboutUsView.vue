    <br>
      <div class="P2 bold">We specialize in Car, Truck, Jeep, & Motorcycle Shows </div>
      
      <div class="P2 bold">Goal</div>
      <div class="P2">Raise funds for local charities and/or those in need.</div>
      
      <div class="P2">We were founded in 2024 by I, Mike Fallos. I has worked the past few year and when I was a teenager with Lou, Dan, & Reggie of North Shore Rods Inc. North Shore Rods Inc. is the original car show club that use to host Scoop the Loop in down town Waukegan, IL and Beach Park Days car show. 
        Over the past 5 years or so they have been hosting Home Depot Gurnee Cruise night and Gurnee Days car show. Lou, Dan, & Reggie approached me during the local cruise night at Home Depot early 2024 about wanting to retire (semi-retire) and turn the car shows over to me. 
        It is a great honor that I accepted their offer, luckily they agreed to stay around and be there any help I need on the way.
        <br><br>This has led to the start of State Line Rods NFP. which I have partnered with two of my best friends who love the car/motorcycle community and are willing to donate their time! Those two great friends are Justin Vincent and Todd Davidson. 
        Justin and I are very convincing and have convinced are better halves (our wifes) Alisha Vincent & Kaitlin Fallos to help us with the enormous amount of paperwork, budgeting, and taxes! Alisha and Kaitlin are not just both amazing mothers of two kids each, but they both are working CPA mommas! 
        We are excited to grow the State Line Rodz community as the time goes and hopefully have amazing people join us!
        <br><br>Now to the important information that every one want to know......... How will we be running show/events!
        <br>GREAT QUESTION! If you have been to Gurnee Days Car Show over the past few years we will be continuing with that idea and be making some changes also. The most important information is that every one that works or helps State Line Rodz NFP. is doing it out of the greatness of their heart because no one is being PAID! 
        We are not doing this for any profit, we are a 501(c)3 Not for Profit Organization!
        <br><br>The goal of our shows is to first and foremost raise money for a local charity or person/family in need, that is the only way we will do a show! Second is to make our shows as much fun as we can for all of our participants and spectators! That includes apparel, dash plaques, awards, raffle prizes, silent auctions, 50/50, and anything else we can come up with. 
        Award information can always be found in our event details! 
        Each event maybe a little different given sponsors and support for that event!
        <br><br>This is going to be a CONSTANT LEARNING process for us at State Line Rodz NFP. because our goal is to always make things better! Also are events will NOT allow politics, foul language, violence, loud outside music, and/or reckless driving. 
        We want a fun and safe environment for all adults and kids! Last, but not least we are always open to opinions, please feel free to email us!
        Make sure to Follow us on Facebook and Instagram for pictures and event info!
        <br><br> 
        At State Line Rodz, we believe in the power of automotive/motorcycle community to drive positive change in our community. We are dedicated to helping our communities and those in need with help of beautiful rodz.
